# Summary

I’ve been doing Threat Hunting for my entire security career. Studying threat actor behavior, assessing an organizations risk, where they’re most vulnerable, where they have gaps in their visibility. At a certain point I realized, I’d only ever get so far without actually becoming the adversary. The moment I popped my first shell, I was hooked. So, I’m a career defender that wants to start breaking stuff to see how best to defend it. I put a premium on Tribal Knowledge Share. Education, public speaking and community building will always be my passions, no matter what team I’m on.
